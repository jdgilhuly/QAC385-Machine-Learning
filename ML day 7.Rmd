Setting up the packages and random seed

```{r setup}
library(MASS)
data(Boston)
```

(1) Creating dataset for training and testing using medv
```{r Dataset}
set.seed(1234)
index <- createDataPartition(Boston$medv,
                              p = 0.8,
                              list = FALSE)
train <- df[index, ]
test <- df[-index, ]

```

(2)
```{r Lads}


```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
